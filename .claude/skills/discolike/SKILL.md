# DiscoLike

DiscoLike is a search engine over 80M+ crawled business websites. It returns companies ranked by what they actually do on the web, not by LinkedIn tags, so it reaches niche verticals and non-English markets other B2B databases miss. Every record carries firmographics; contacts, technographics, growth metrics, enrichment, segmentation, and CRM push are one more call away.

Requires a paid plan from $99/month. There is no free tier. Counting results is free.

## Pick the access mode

1. **MCP server** if the client supports remote MCP (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf). URL `https://api.discolike.com/v1/mcp`, OAuth 2.1, no key to manage. Tools appear in the client after one browser authorization. Install snippets: https://discolike.com/mcp.md
2. **CLI** when shelling out. `pip install "discolike[cli]"`, then `discolike auth login` (browser OAuth) or `discolike auth login --api-key KEY`. Always pass `--format json`.
3. **Python SDK** when writing a script. `pip install discolike`, `Discolike()` reads `DISCOLIKE_API_KEY`. Reference: https://docs.discolike.com/sdk/reference/
4. **REST** as last resort: `GET https://api.discolike.com/v1/discover`, header `X-API-Key`. OpenAPI at https://api.discolike.com/v1/openapi.json. Auth summary: https://discolike.com/auth.md

If the MCP server is not connected in this session, check with the user before installing it. Never paste an API key into a config file the user did not ask for.

## No account yet

Create it without a browser. No credential comes back; the person confirms by email, logs in, picks a plan, and issues the key or authorizes the MCP client.

```
POST https://api.discolike.com/v1/public/signup
Content-Type: application/json

{"email": "<work email>", "first_name": "<first>", "last_name": "<last>", "agent": "<your name>"}
```

Ask the user for any value you do not know. Relay the `next_step` text from the response. Free-mail and disposable domains are rejected. `409` means the account exists, send the user to log in. Guide: https://docs.discolike.com/guides/agent-signup/

## How to search

Three ways to describe the target, all on the same `discover` call. Combine them.

| Want | Parameter | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Plain-English ICP | `icp_prompt` | Extracts filters and seed domains from the sentence. Prefer over `icp_text`. |
| Companies like these | `domain` (up to 10) | Ranked by similarity to what the seed companies do. |
| Homepage says X | `phrase_match` (up to 20) | Exact text fragments. |
| Narrow | `country`, `state`, `employee_range` ("51,500"), `revenue_range`, `tech_stack`, `category`, `language`, `business_model` | Every filter has a `negate_` twin. |
| Size the set | `count` with the same filters | Free. Do this before a large `discover`. |
| Cap spend | `max_records` | Start with 100 to 500 to check fit, then scale. |

Each search bills a query fee plus a fee per 1,000 new records. Records seen in the last 90 days are free. Results cap at 10,000 per call; for more, put what you have into an exclusion list and run the next call with `exclusion_query_id`. Exclusion lists hold up to 250,000 domains and 500,000 contacts on every plan.

## After discovery

- Contacts at the matched companies: contacts search with a persona description, seniority, or department. Returns verified email, phone, LinkedIn.
- Enrich a list you already have: bizdata, vendors, growth, score, redirects, subsidiaries per domain, or bulk append from CSV.
- Segment a customer list into ICP clusters with descriptions, then run lookalikes per cluster.
- Validate a list against an ICP description for fit yes/partial/no with reasoning.
- Push to HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive via the CRM tools.

## Flows

Each flow lists the MCP tool, the CLI command, and the SDK call. Async steps return a job; wait on it before the next step. Save intermediate result sets as queries so later steps reference an id instead of re-sending domains.

Before any flow: check spend with MCP `account-status`, CLI `discolike account usage`, SDK `client.account.usage()`, and report it. Before any paid pull larger than a sample (roughly 100 records), state the estimated cost from the count and the plan's per-1,000 rate and get a yes. Write raw results to disk as JSON or CSV; chat output truncates.

### Flow 1: discover, verify, contacts, ContaGen

Build a target list, confirm fit, get named people, then fill the gaps with live web research.

1. **Size it.** MCP `count-matching-domains`. CLI `discolike count --phrase-match "..." --country US`. SDK `client.count(CountParams(...))`. Free.
2. **Discover.** MCP `discover-similar-companies`. CLI `discolike discover --icp-prompt "..." --domain seed.com --country US --max-records 500 --format json`. SDK `client.discover(DiscoverParams(icp_prompt=..., domain=[...], max_records=500))`. Start at 100 to 500, inspect, then scale. Do not set an employee minimum unless asked; small-company headcount data is thin and rarely what disqualifies. After every pull, add its domains to an exclusion list: MCP `save-exclusion-list`, CLI `discolike queries create-exclusion-list --name "tam-round-1" --domain a.com --domain b.com --tag tam`, SDK `client.queries.create_exclusion_list(CreateExclusionListRequest(query_name="tam-round-1", domains=[...], tags=["tam"]))`. Pass that list's id as `exclusion_query_id` on the next pull so rounds never overlap. Save the search itself with `save-mcp-query` or `queries save-results` only when you want to rerun it later.
3. **Verify fit.** MCP `validate-icp-fit`. CLI `discolike validate-icp --icp "..." --domain a.com --domain b.com --wait --format json` (or `--file domains.csv`). SDK `job = client.validate_icp(ValidateIcpRequest(icp_text=..., domains=[...], web_search=True)); job.wait()`. Returns yes/partial/no with reasoning per domain. Keep `yes`, review `partial`, drop `no`. A 60 to 70 percent yes rate on a first pull is normal, not a failed search. Uses the account's LLM provider key.
4. **Contacts.** MCP `search-contacts`. CLI `discolike contacts search --domain a.com --domain b.com --seniority executive --department Sales --has-email --format json`. SDK `client.contacts.search(ContactsSearchParams(domain=[...], seniority=["executive"], department=["Sales"], has_email=True, max_records=200))`. Billed per new contact record. `--icp-prompt` on contacts search derives persona filters from a sentence.
5. **ContaGen for the rest.** For domains where step 4 returned nobody, MCP `generate-contacts`. CLI `discolike contacts generate --icp-text "VP Sales or Head of Revenue" --domain a.com --domain b.com --wait --format json`. SDK `job = client.contacts.generate(ContactGenerateRequest(icp_text=..., domains=[...], max_contacts_per_domain=3)); job.wait()`. Runs live web search per company on the user's own LLM and search provider keys; every email is verified before it is shown. No platform billing. Treat output as candidates.
6. **Deliver.** CSV, or push to the CRM with MCP `push-to-crm` (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive).

### Flow 2: enrich a CRM export

The user has a CSV of accounts and wants DiscoLike fields on every row.

1. **Domains, not names.** If the file has websites, use that column, normalized: lowercase, scheme and `www.` stripped, path dropped. If it only has company names, run Flow 3 first. Parse and write CSV with a real CSV library; description fields contain commas.
2. **Append.** MCP `append-data`. CLI `discolike append accounts.csv --domain-column website --dataset bizdata --dataset vendors --dataset growth --output enriched.csv`. SDK `client.append(AppendParams(domain_column="website", dataset=["bizdata", "vendors", "growth"]), file=open("accounts.csv", "rb"))`. Datasets: `bizdata` (name, address, phones, industry, employees, revenue range, description), `domain_status`, `redirects`, `growth`, `vendors`. Up to 10,000 rows per request. Billed per new company record; rows seen in the last 90 days are free.
3. **Single domains** when it is a handful: MCP `business-profile`, `vendor-and-technology-data`, `growth-metrics`, `digital-footprint-score`. CLI `discolike company data stripe.com --format json`. SDK `client.companies.data(CompaniesDataParams(domain="stripe.com"))`, plus `.vendors`, `.growth`, `.score`, `.redirects`, `.subsidiaries`.
4. **Write back.** MCP `crm-enrich-contacts` and `crm-writeback-domains` update records in a connected CRM directly.

### Flow 3: match company names to domains

The user has names, maybe city or phone, and no websites.

1. **One at a time.** MCP `match-company-to-domain`. CLI `discolike match --name "Acme Robotics" --city Austin --state TX --country US --format json`. SDK `client.match.company(MatchCompanyParams(name="Acme Robotics", city="Austin", state="TX", country="US"))`. Returns ranked candidates with confidence; nothing below 50 is returned. Raise `min_match_confidence` to tighten. Name matching costs nothing.
2. **In bulk.** MCP `bulk-match-company-to-domain`. CLI `discolike match --file companies.csv --name-column company --city-column city --country-column country --wait --format json`. SDK `job = client.match.bulk(MatchBulkParams(name_column="company", city_column="city", country_column="country"), file=open("companies.csv", "rb")); job.wait()`. Rows the backend could not process carry `match_error: search_failed`, which is not the same as no match.
3. **Then enrich** with Flow 2, or suppress against the CRM with MCP `crm-match-companies`.

### Flow 4: segment a client list into ICPs

The user has their customers and wants to know what kinds of companies they actually sell to, then find more of each kind.

1. **Segment.** MCP `segment-domains`. CLI `discolike segment --file customers.csv --domain-column website --max-segments 6 --wait --format json`. SDK `job = client.segment_file(SegmentFileParams(domain_column="website", max_segments=6), file=open("customers.csv", "rb")); job.wait()`, or `client.segment(SegmentParams(domains="a.com,b.com,...", max_segments=6))` for an inline list. Output: clusters with an auto-written description and a probability per domain.
2. **Read the clusters.** Present each segment's description and size. Ask which segments matter; the biggest is not always the best.
3. **Lookalikes per segment.** For a chosen segment, run Flow 1 step 2 with that segment's top domains as `domain` seeds (up to 10) and its description as `icp_prompt`. Exclude the existing customers with an exclusion list built from the customer file (MCP `save-exclusion-list`, CLI `discolike queries create-exclusion-list`, SDK `client.queries.create_exclusion_list`) passed as `exclusion_query_id`; `exclude_domain` is for a handful of domains, capped at 100.
4. **Validate and hand off** with Flow 1 steps 3 to 6. Name each segment as a campaign lane and write the label to the CRM with MCP `crm-writeback-segments`, so every account carries exactly one lane and sequences stay separate.

### Flow 5: market map to N

The user wants the whole addressable market, thousands of accounts, not a sample.

1. **Anchor.** Count with the structural filters alone (country, size, category). That number is the ceiling; if it is far from the user's own estimate, the filters are wrong, fix them before spending.
2. **Calibrate on 50.** One inclusion-only pull, `max_records=50`, seeds plus `icp_prompt`, `variance="MEDIUM"`, no negations. Validate fit. Then change one lever per round: first exclude the high-similarity wrong-category anchors, then add two or three confirmed fits as seeds, and only then add a phrase. Never negate a phrase the real targets also use. Excluding a domain: MCP `discover-similar-companies` with `negate_domain` (shapes the ranking), CLI `--param negate_domain=a.com,b.com`, SDK `exclude_domain` (hard filter only). Re-run at 200 and read ranks 1 to 10, 90 to 100, and 190 to 200; quality decays with rank, and the tail tells you where to stop.
3. **Round.** Pull 500 to 1,000. Add every domain to the exclusion list. Validate. Record fit rate.
4. **Next round.** Same query, `exclusion_query_id` pointing at the exclusion list, two new seeds from the last round's best fits, `max_records` up to 1,000. Repeat. One list per market map, grown each round, is simpler than one list per round.
5. **Stop.** When a round's fit rate drops under about 30 percent, or net-new fits fall under 5 percent of the pull, the market is mapped. Push past that only with a different `icp_prompt` (an adjacent segment), not a bigger `max_records`.
6. **Deliver.** Union the rounds, dedupe on bare domain, keep the round number and similarity on each row.

A 70/20/10 split works for a portfolio: 70 percent of records from the proven prompt, 20 from an adjacent one, 10 from an experimental one, all sharing the one exclusion list.

### Flow 6: ICP from a website

New account, no ICP written down, or "set up my ICP".

1. **Read the source.** MCP `extract-website-text` on the user's own domain, or on their best customer's. CLI `discolike extract https://example.com --format json`. SDK `client.companies.extract(CompaniesExtractParams(domain="example.com"))`.
2. **Draft.** From the text write one `icp_prompt` sentence, two or three `phrase_match` candidates that a target's homepage would say, a `category`, and the filters that are truly hard (country, business model). Split hard filters from preferences: if the user would still contact a company without it, it is a preference, so leave it out of the filter and let ranking handle it.
3. **Count each phrase** on its own. A phrase that counts in the hundreds is a filter; one in the tens is a seed list; one in the hundreds of thousands is noise.
4. **Sample 25.** Show domains and one-line descriptions. Ask the user to mark fits and misses in place.
5. **Correct and save.** Adjust from the marks, re-sample once, then save the query with a name and tags. Every later flow starts from that id.

### Flow 7: signal-qualified list

"Find X that run Shopify", "that are hiring SDRs", "that publish case studies", "that have a pricing page".

1. **Base list.** Flow 1 steps 1 and 2, or an existing saved query.
2. **Deterministic signals first.** Technology in use: `tech_stack` on discover, or MCP `vendor-and-technology-data`, CLI `discolike company vendors example.com --format json`, SDK `client.companies.vendors(CompaniesVendorsParams(domain=..., match="client"))`. Growth and footprint: `growth-metrics`, `digital-footprint-score`. Homepage wording: `phrase_match`. Recently hired leadership: contacts search with `jobstart_date`. No model call for anything a filter answers.
3. **DiscoGen for the rest.** One call for the whole list, one question, structured answer: `{"answer": "yes|no|unknown", "evidence": "<quote from the page>", "confidence": 0-1}`. `web_search=true` only when the answer is not on the site (job posts, funding). Drop `unknown`; do not turn it into `no`.
4. **Route.** `yes` rows go to the campaign with the evidence quote carried as a merge field, so the first line of outreach cites the fact. Everything else goes to a separate list or waits for the next signal.
5. **Contacts** for the qualified set only, Flow 1 steps 4 and 5.

### Flow 8: technology and infrastructure targeting

"Companies running Shopify and Klaviyo", "who uses SendGrid", "who advertises on Meta", "what does acme.com run".

1. **Which direction.** Find companies that use a vendor: `tech_stack` on discover or count, CLI `--tech-stack shopify.com`, SDK `DiscoverParams(tech_stack=[...])`, MCP `discover-similar-companies`. Find what one company uses: MCP `vendor-and-technology-data` with `match=client`, CLI `discolike company vendors acme.com --format json`, SDK `client.companies.vendors(CompaniesVendorsParams(domain="acme.com", match="client"))`. `match=vendor` on the same call lists a vendor's clients.
2. **Vendors are domains.** `shopify.com`, `hubspot.com`, `klaviyo.com`, up to 20 per search. Count each vendor alone first; anything under about 1,000 companies worldwide is too thin to build a segment on.
3. **AND, not OR.** Multiple `tech_stack` values are OR by default. Prefix with `+` to require all: `+shopify.com +klaviyo.com +gorgias.com`. Same rule for `phrase_match`.
4. **Fragmented stacks.** Consolidation pitches want companies on point tools with no suite. AND the point tools, then `negate_tech_stack` the suites that would replace them (`salesforce.com`, `hubspot.com`).
5. **Advertisers.** Meta: `facebook.net` (pixel), `facebook.com`, `meta.com`, `instagram.com`. Google Ads, tight: `doubleclick.net`, `googlesyndication.com`, `googleadservices.com`. Google, broad: `googletagmanager.com` and analytics domains, which most advertisers have and many non-advertisers too. Pixel present is binary; spend or volume is a DiscoGen estimate, see below.
6. **Email sending stack.** Filter on the ESP or sequencer as `tech_stack` (`sendgrid.com`, `instantly.ai`, `smartlead.ai`, `mailgun.com`, `marketo.com`). The discover response carries `mx_provider` inline (`google.com`, `microsoft.com`, `no_mx` means the domain does not receive mail, a parked-domain filter). Sending-domain portfolio size: reverse redirects, MCP `domain-redirects` with `match=linked`, CLI `discolike company redirects acme.com --match linked`, SDK `client.companies.redirects(CompaniesRedirectsParams(domain=..., match="linked"))`, or bulk `append` with dataset `redirects` for `redirect_count`. Newest rotated domains can lag a crawl cycle.
7. **Detection limits.** Signals come from scripts, meta tags, tag-manager containers, and certificates on the public site. A tool with no web-facing footprint (a CRM used only internally) will not show; an empty result means no public signal, not no tool. Vendors that provision customers on subdomains (`client.vendor.com`) are not mapped automatically; pull the vendor's certificate set, extract the client names, and run them through Flow 3 bulk match. There is no Google Business Profile filter; that is a DiscoGen question.

### Flow 9: rank or filter a list the user already has

"Score these 3,000 accounts against our ICP", "which of our customers run HubSpot", "run research on this list".

1. **Load the list.** A saved domain list serves as inclusion scope as well as exclusion; the upload path is the same. MCP `save-exclusion-list`; CLI `discolike queries create-exclusion-list --name "crm-accounts" --domain a.com --domain b.com`; SDK `client.queries.create_exclusion_list(CreateExclusionListRequest(query_name="crm-accounts", domains=[...]))`. Minimum 20 domains. Names first? Flow 3.
2. **Rank it.** Discover with `inclusion_query_id` set to that list plus an `icp_prompt` or seed domains; the response is the user's own companies ordered by similarity, with firmographics. Available from Starter. CLI `--inclusion-query-id <id>`; SDK `DiscoverParams(inclusion_query_id=[...], icp_prompt=...)`.
3. **Bucket it.** Same call with `tech_stack` instead of a prompt returns only the companies on that vendor. Repeat per vendor to split the list.
4. **Research it.** Point DiscoGen, validate-icp, or ContaGen at the list directly, up to 10,000 domains per run. Rows the user pulled in the last 90 days are cached, so DiscoLike-side cost is the submit fee.
5. **Explain the gaps.** Domains that return no profile are not lost: `append` with dataset `domain_status` says why (non-business, parked, dead, redirect, no certificate).

## When results look wrong

Work top to bottom; the first fix usually ends it. Adding more exclusion language is almost never the answer.

1. **Negations inside the ICP text.** "Does not sell apparel, candles, supplements" in `icp_prompt` or `icp_text` pulls results toward those words; the text is matched on meaning, not read as rules. Strip every negative clause; describe only what the ideal company is.
2. **A positive category too broad.** E-Commerce admits every DTC brand. Pick the narrowest positive category that still contains the targets before touching any negation.
3. **Seeds that bridge into the noise.** Seeds are the strongest signal in the search. Read each seed with `extract-website-text`: a fitness wearable site reads as running and wellness, so sportswear follows. Do not mix sub-verticals in one search; run them separately, net-new billing makes the split free for repeats.
4. **A seed that is the wrong company.** Guessed domains resolve to the wrong business. Confirm each seed with `extract-website-text` before the first pull.
5. **Boilerplate phrases.** `phrase_match` is OR, and "shop now", "free shipping", "official store" appear on every storefront, so they pass everything. Drop them; prefix product-specific phrases with `+` to require them.
6. **Bleed inside your own categories.** Negating a category or phrase only catches companies classified there or using that word. Recurring offenders go on an exclusion list; that is the backstop, not more text.
7. **Precision levers.** `variance` controls how far down the ranked list the search runs before industry drift cuts it off: LOW, MID_LOW, MEDIUM, MID_HIGH, HIGH, UNRESTRICTED. The app defaults to MEDIUM; the API defaults to UNRESTRICTED, which turns the guard off, so always set it explicitly on API and SDK calls (`DiscoverParams(variance="MEDIUM")`, CLI `--variance MEDIUM`). MEDIUM to MID_HIGH barely moves the count; HIGH is the step that lets the list run materially further. UNRESTRICTED is not a mining mode; every company resembles something. `min_similarity` (0 to 99) drops the tail below a score. `consensus` (1 to 20, default 1) is how many top results are blended into the reference vector; higher is broader. `min_digital_footprint` defaults to 50 on a 0 to 800 scale; lowering it surfaces real companies with thin sites and usually moves the count more than headcount does, so step down gradually and look. `employee_range` "201,+" keeps the 10001+ bucket that "201,10000" drops. The real end of a niche is when results stop looking like fits, not when a count stops falling.
8. **Counts that do not add up.** A vendor or country badge is a single-criterion worldwide total. Walk the chain with `count`, adding one filter at a time, and the drop becomes visible and explainable.

### DiscoGen, when a question is not a filter

"Do they sell to hospitals?", "Is pricing public?", "Estimated monthly ad spend?" are research prompts, not filters. MCP `run-discogen` on a domain list with `web_search=true`, one call for the whole list, never one call per domain and never split across parallel tasks: all tasks share the user's provider key and rate-limit each other. CLI `discolike discogen ...`. SDK `client.discogen.process(DiscoGenProcessRequest(query=..., domains=[...], web_search=True))` then `job.wait()`. Runs on the user's own LLM and search keys; DiscoLike bills a submit fee plus net-new records, and records from the last 90 days are cached, so a rerun costs the submit fee.

Rules that decide whether the column is usable:

- **Narrow first.** DiscoGen hit rate is set by its input. Do all the filtering Discover can do (`phrase_match` "case study", `tech_stack`, category, geo) before dispatching; a tight list beats validating a noisy one after.
- **Preview on known answers.** Dry-run the prompt on 20 to 50 domains where the user already knows the truth, fix the prompt, then run the list.
- **Numbered questions become columns.** "1. Is the industry classification accurate, yes or no. 2. Do they have US engineers." returns two columns in one pass. Keep it to a few; eight questions at once degrade all of them.
- **DiscoGen owns the answer shape, not your prompt (paid for 2026-09-12, runs 24517 and 24520).** It infers a `response_format` from the query and normalizes every answer to it. A one-question prompt comes back as a bare value per domain ("B2B"), and an instruction like "respond with a JSON object with keys answer, evidence, confidence" is ignored: the wrapper is stripped and only the value survives. A numbered prompt comes back as an object per domain whose keys DiscoGen names itself (`{market_type, supporting_quote, confidence}` for "1. B2B or B2C? 2. Quote a supporting sentence. 3. Your confidence 0 to 1"), with the labels in the task's `response_format.field_labels` and the key order in `json_schema.required`. So: want evidence and confidence, ask for them as questions 2 and 3, and map the object by label, never by a key you chose. Enrich Discogen Research (the Rootflow) does exactly that.
- **Two passes, two models.** Pass 1: extraction-only questions on the full list with a cheap model. Filter on that column. Pass 2: the reasoning question on the survivors with a strong model. Same or lower cost, better accuracy.
- **Yes/no prompts.** Ask for `answer` yes/no/unknown, `evidence` as a short quote, `confidence` 0 to 1. Treat unknown as abstain, never as no. Do not list example nouns ("YES examples: drums, pallets"); models match the nouns instead of the criterion. Do not put conflicting criteria in one prompt.
- **Estimates.** Traffic, ad spend, headcount growth: the number is rarely public. Conservative models return "not available" on most rows. Use a Google model, ask for a range and an above/below threshold, and label the output directional.
- **Search provider over native web search.** A dedicated search provider (Serper and the other BYOS options) returns compact snippets and a fixed per-search price. The model's built-in search at high context pulls unpredictable page content and can run several times the estimate. Never pick an OpenAI `-search-preview` model; those search on every call regardless of the toggle. Lower search depth before raising the model tier.
- **ContaGen is extraction.** Names and titles out of search results. Use the latest Haiku or a GPT mini class model; a reasoning model costs several times more for the same triples. It searches the open web, it does not crawl a site's team page on demand. Niche titles (head of procurement, logistics manager) have low fill rates because they are sparse online; that is data availability, not a failed run.
- **Model reasoning is non-deterministic.** Borderline rows flip between runs and between models. Report the yes count with the model name attached.

## Examples

CLI:

```bash
discolike count --phrase-match "managed detection and response" --country DE
discolike discover --domain stripe.com --domain adyen.com --employee-range 51,500 --max-records 500 --format json
discolike discover --icp-prompt "cybersecurity for SMBs, managed IT, endpoint protection" --country US --max-records 100 --format json
```

Python:

```python
from discolike import Discolike
from discolike.requests import DiscoverParams, CountParams

client = Discolike()
n = client.count(CountParams(phrase_match=["managed detection and response"], country=["DE"])).count
companies = client.discover(DiscoverParams(domain=["stripe.com", "adyen.com"], employee_range="51,500", max_records=500))
```
